      title: "Digital Shamanic Activism",
      summary: "Digital Shamanic Activism is a text documented by the independent Colombian artist based in Montreal, going by the alias of Anormal. In this work, and from his point of view, he expresses the positive results he perceived when developing a series of white magic spells to influence the fall of one of the immigration control tools used in North America in 2021, favouring particular interests. Anormal invites the reader to select a noble cause to which they feel inspired to contribute to, and use mystical tools to boost personal growth or help mitigate an undesired social picture and enhance positive societal situations.",

          title: "Intriguing book",
          comment: "Wow, this wasn’t what I expected at all, thinking the book would be the “digital shaman” concept of divorcing oneself from tech, but instead this is a mystifying conspiracy-like mixture of white magic and technology and how it can relate to activism in politics across the world and Caribbean. The book frankly made my head spin, but in a good way. It’s appropriate that it began as an art project, because like good art, it’s a challenging read that will make you question what activism can mean. A very intriguing read for those politically-minded or looking for something different!",

          title: "Controversial and wild",
          comment: `I think it's important, especially in our modern & heavily-siloed world, to expose ourselves to new and different ideas that can help us better understand and empathize with others. And so, while I find this book WILD in its core stances and beliefs, I do honestly connect with many lines of thought (for example, feelings of injustice and abuse meted against us by corporations and governments), and I highly respect the author's commitment to practice what he's "preaching" when he says it is ultimately up to each of us to investigate claims and believe in things because we have researched and found them to be true, and not simply because an "authority figure" has declared it true, or because it is the only option presented to us. While I'm not 100% on board with the message, I find it worthwhile to read.`,

          comment: `Digital Shamanic Activism" by Anormal is a mind-bending journey through art, magic, and social change. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is an interesting story. Imagine this Colombian artist based in Montreal, cooking up white magic spells to take down oppressive immigration systems in North America in 2021. And get this - they're inviting us to join in! Pick a cause you're passionate about, dive into some mystical mojo, and let's change the world together. Anormal's vibe is all about empowerment and shaking up the status quo for the better. It's like a wild ride of hope and inspiration that'll leave you itching to make your mark on the world.`,

          comment: `This is not quite was I was expecting but it was so much more. As a reference for shamanism this book will help the reader to work through their own practice within each of us. It actually is a great way to learn about how to focus on taking care of a shamanic tradition of freedom for all people. This allows for each of us to become our own activist and look out for those who are unable to look out for themselves in many cases... This book goes a long way to work through that for each of us.`,

          comment: `This book definitely pushes the boundaries for the average-thinking person. The author, "Anormal," is missing a B in his name, as he's not your "normal" writer. What's interesting is how he sees art as a digital power for change. He suggests picking a cause you care about and using mystical tools for personal and societal growth, to spread the message. The book shows how his magical efforts had positive outcomes and encourages readers to try using it too, to contribute to a better society. It's certainly thought-provoking, and challenges the reader to transcend their own and societal boundaries with the use of art and magic in making a difference.`,
